# The Sustainability of Countries' Development Over Time

## Project Overview

### Research Questions
1) Is the sustainability of a country related to its development and GDP?
2) How have these trends differed over time?

### Motivation
First, I would like to confirm that the development of a country and its GDP are correlated with its overall carbon emission levels.
Then, I would like to view these trends over time and determine whether development nowadays is more or less sustainable than it was in the past.

If I can establish the trend between the development of a country and its total carbon emissions, particularly over time, we can better understand how development can occur in a more sustainable way.

### Predictions

I predict that 1) the total carbon emissions of a country will increase as its GDP increases, and 2) countries that are developing now (in the 21st Century) will have higher total carbon emissions than countries that developed in the 20th Century.

### Methods

First, I will aggregate the GDP, CO2 emissions, and HDI data by year and country.
I will assess the relationships between those variables in general.

Then, I will assess the relationship between the three variables over time. I will also create visualizations that show these relationships (likely line graphs and some maps).

Specifically, I will compare countries that developed in the 20th Century (like North America, Western Europe, Australia/NZ, Japan, etc) compared to those that have developed or are still developing in the 21st Century (like China, India, Brazil, etc).

## Getting Started
### Installing Dependencies

To ensure that you have all the dependencies installed, and that we can have a reproducible environment, we will be using `pipenv` to manage our dependencies. `pipenv` is a tool that allows us to create a virtual environment for our project, and install all the dependencies we need for our project. This ensures that we can have a reproducible environment, and that we can all run the same code.

```bash
pipenv install
```

This sets up a virtual environment for our project, and installs the following dependencies:

- `ipykernel`
- `jupyter`
- `notebook`
- `black`
  Throughout your analysis and development, you will need to install additional packages. You can can install any package you need using `pipenv install <package-name>`. For example, if you need to install `numpy`, you can do so by running:

```bash
pipenv install numpy
```

This will update update the `Pipfile` and `Pipfile.lock` files, and install the package in your virtual environment.

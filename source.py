# # The Sustainability of Countries' Development Over Time üìù
# 
# <!-- ![Banner](./assets/banner.jpeg) -->

# ## Topic
# *What problem are you (or your stakeholder) trying to address?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->

# I want to understand how the development of a country affects environmental sustainability.

# ## Project Question
# *What specific question are you seeking to answer with this project?*
# *This is not the same as the questions you ask to limit the scope of the project.*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->

# 1) Is the carbon footprint of a country related to its development and GDP?
# 2) How have these trends differed over time?
# 
# First, I would like to confirm that the development of a country and its GDP are correlated with its overall carbon emission levels.
# Then, I would like to view these trends over time and determine whether development nowadays is more or less sustainable than it was in the past.

# ## What would an answer look like?
# *What is your hypothesized answer to your question?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->

# If I can establish the trend between the development of a country and its total carbon emissions, particularly over time, we can better understand how development can occur in a more sustainable way.
# 
# I predict that 1) the total carbon emissions of a country will increase as its GDP increases, and 2) countries that are developing now (in the 21st Century) will have higher total carbon emissions than countries that developed in the 20th Century.

# ## Data Sources
# *What 3 data sources have you identified for this project?*
# *How are you going to relate these datasets?*
# üìù <!-- Answer Below -->

# I have identified the following datasets that I will use:
# 
# - [ONU Sustainability of Countries Development](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vittoriogiatti/unsdg-united-nations-sustainable-development-group)
# - [Wikipedia - Countries by HDI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index)
# - [CO2 Emissions by Country (per capita)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/EN.ATM.CO2E.PC)
# - [Annual GDP % Growth by Country](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD.ZG)

# ## Approach and Analysis
# *What is your approach to answering your project question?*
# *How will you use the identified data to answer your project question?*
# üìù <!-- Start Discussing the project here; you can add as many code cells as you need -->

# First, I will aggregate the GDP, CO2 emissions, and HDI data by year and country.
# I will assess the relationships between those variables in general.
# 
# Then, I will assess the relationship between the three variables over time. I will also create visualizations that show these relationships (likely line graphs and some maps).
# 
# Specifically, I will compare countries that developed in the 20th Century (like North America, Western Europe, Australia/NZ, Japan, etc) compared to those that have developed or are still developing in the 21st Century (like China, India, Brazil, etc).

# ## Great, now we have our 215 countries from each dataset üéâ
# 
# But, our datasets differ in when they start tracking data for each country.
# 
# - For GDP, The earliest data is from 1961, but it only includes 92 countries. The world geography was quite different then (the USSR was still a thing, for example). By 2021, we have about 200 countries.
# - For CO2 emissions, the earliest data is from 1990, but it only includes 92 countries. It goes up to 2019, where we have 191 countries.
# 
# So, our datasets agree about which countries exist, but we don't necessarily have data for all of them for the same time period.
# 
# I think we will be able to get a good idea of the trends by just looking at the data from 1990-2019.

# ### Emissions by Demographic Dividend Stage

# Demographic dividend is the period of time when a country's working-age population is growing faster than its overall population.
# The WorldBank databases classify countries into 4 stages based on their development status and include an aggregate measure of emissions for all countries in each of the 4 stages.
# 
# The 4 stages are:
# - 'PRE': Pre-dividend countries are mostly low-income countries, lagging in key human development indicators and with current fertility levels above four births per woman. They face very rapid population growth.
# - 'EAR': Early-dividend countries are mostly lower-middle-income countries further along the fertility transition. Fertility rates have fallen below four births per woman and the working-age share of the population is likely rising considerably.
# - 'LTE': Late-dividend countries are mostly upper middle-income countries. Fertility rates are typically above replacement levels of 2.1 births per woman but continue to decline with shrinking working-age shares and rapid aging.
# - 'PST': Post-dividend countries are mostly high-income countries where fertility has transitioned below replacement levels.
# 
# It is difficult to discern which specific countries are classified by WorldBank as 'PRE', 'EAR', 'LTE', and 'PST' dividend countries. However, we can be reasonably sure that "developed" countries are in the 'PST' stage, and "developing" countries are in the 'EAR' or 'LTE' stage.
# Most likely, 'POST' includes countries like the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Western Europe, while 'EAR' and 'LTE' include countries like China, India, Brazil, and other developing countries.

# We can see that globally, late-dividend (developing) countries produce the highest overall emissions -- more than post-dividend countries (developed).
# The developed world is decreasing its emissions, while the developing world is increasing its emissions.
# 
# The developed world has greater emissions per capita than the developing world.
# The good news is that this is going down. The bad news is that the damage has already been done when those countries were developing in the 20th Century.
